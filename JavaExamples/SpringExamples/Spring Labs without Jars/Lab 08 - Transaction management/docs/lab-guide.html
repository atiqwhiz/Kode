I want to show you one full-fledged example on annotations and this example achieves the same. In this example none of the user defined beans are configured in the xml.</p><p>There are many classes in this example, so spend some time getting familiar with these classes. </p><ul><li>Start by reviewing the Hibernate entities in the <code>entity</code> package. These entities are the ones which have been mapped to the tables in the database.</li><li>Next we have 3 repository classes in this example, <code>OrderRepository</code> , <code>PaymentRepository</code> and <code>ProductRepository</code>. Please go through with the respective implementation classes as well.</li><li>Now have a look at <code>OnlineShoppingService</code> interface and it&#8217;s implementation <code>OnlineShoppingServiceImpl</code> defined in the <code>service</code> package. This service class will act as an entry point in the application. The diagram below gives you a quick idea about the overall configuration.</li></ul><p><img border="0" src="flow.jpg"/> </p><p>Since we are using annotations, only the infrastructure configuration is found in <code>ex-config.xml</code> file. Please review the configuration and see if you are able to relate is correctly to the code.</p><p>Before you run the test class, you need to create a small table whose script i&#8217;ve provided you in the <code>resources</code> folder.</p><p>By default when you run the test class, everything will commit and you will be able to see the changes getting reflected in the following tables: <code>tx_orders</code> , <code>tx_payments</code> and <code>tx_products</code>.</p><p>Once you get comfortable with the example, now we need to try out different options as discussed in <b>slide no. 286-294</b>. I&#8217;ll take over from here. We will try it out together since i also need to discuss a bit more about the same.</p><h1 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h1><p>If you are reading this conclusion before completing the lab, then we haven&#8217;t yet concluded. Thank you!</p></body></html>
