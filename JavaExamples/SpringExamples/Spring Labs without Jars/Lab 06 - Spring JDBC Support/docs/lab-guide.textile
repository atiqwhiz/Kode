h1. Lab 6. Spring JDBC Support

h1. Quickstart

In this small lab, you will evaluate how JdbcTemplate class simplifies writing JDBC code. This example contains a small class by the name @JdbcFlightRepository@ class in the @repository@ class. Review each and every method and see if you are finding the API comfortable to learn. Refer **slide no. 238-248** for details on the same.

The small test class @FlightRepositoryTest@ from the @test@ package can be used for testing individual methods one by one.

If time permits, try out some of the ways of writing a Repository class as mentioned in the slides.

Oops. That's the end of this lab guide!
